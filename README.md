# EmailCheckerNET

##Basic Idea

This component let the programmer check if email mailbox exists without having to send an email for this process.
There is a lot of online tools for this, but all the options that I found was for paid or with limitations.
For example:
https://verify-email.org/
https://email-checker.net/
https://hunter.io/email-verifier

So, as a first project on github I want to share what I learn on my research, and if possible reduce these reseach time for other developers that require this functionallity on their projects.

Hopefully this will be usefull for someone.
