# EmailCheckerNET

## Basic Idea of the project

This component lets the programmer check if email mailbox exists without having to send an email for this process.
There is a lot of online tools for this, but all the options that I found were for paid or with limitations.

For example:

https://verify-email.org/

https://email-checker.net/

https://hunter.io/email-verifier

So, as a first project on github I want to share what I learn on my research, and if possible reduce this reseach time for other developers that require this functionallity on their projects.

Hopefully this will be usefull for someone.
